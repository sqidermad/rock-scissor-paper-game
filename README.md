# Rock-Scissor-Paper-Game
Rock-Scissor-Paper-Game is a console-based game developed for the Algorithm course project. The game was built using the C++ programming language and ASCII character designs.

## Description
This project is a console-based rock-scissor-paper game where two players take turns selecting rock, scissor, or paper. The game follows the traditional rules, where rock beats scissor, scissor beats paper, and paper beats rock. The game's characters and graphics are designed using ASCII characters.

The source code is written in C++ and is stored in .cpp files. The game needs to be compiled using a C++ compiler before it can be played.

## Method or Topic
The game was developed as a project for the Algorithm course, but the specific topic or method used in the project is currently unknown. This section will be updated in the future with more information.

## How to Run
To run the Rock-Scissor-Paper-Game, you will need to compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Once compiled, you can execute the resulting binary file to start the game. The game will be displayed on the console/terminal.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our Algorithm course instructor for giving us the opportunity to work on this project and learn about various topics related to algorithms.
